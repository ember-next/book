# Welcome to Ember Next!

Ember is changing quickly these days, and while we may not be moving \(and breaking\) at the speed of the rest of the Javascript ecosystems, it can still feel confusing as so many new patterns come together in the framework at once. Native classes, decorators, Typescript, Sparkles and Glimmer components, @tracked, and more and more - it seems like the new features never end!

If you've found this book, you are probably a curious Emberista who is trying to figure out how all these new features and patterns will work in the future, or maybe even looking to be an early adopter of some of them. You're in the right place! This book is maintained by community members who are keeping close tabs on what's coming next in Ember. We're consolidating all information and current best practices here so that there is a single source of truth to refer to when you're trying to figure out how to use new features, how stable they are, and what patterns are well tested and which are footguns-in-waiting.
